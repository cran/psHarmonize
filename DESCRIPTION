Description: Functions which facilitate harmonization of data from multiple
    different datasets. Data harmonization involves taking data sources with
    differing values, creating coding instructions to create a harmonized
    set of values, then making those data modifications. 'psHarmonize' will
    assist with data modification once the harmonization instructions are
    written. Coding instructions are written by the user to create a
    "harmonization sheet". This sheet catalogs variable names, domains
    (e.g. clinical, behavioral, outcomes), provides R code instructions for
    mapping or conversion of data, specifies the variable name in the
    harmonized data set, and tracks notes. The package will then harmonize
    the source datasets according to the harmonization sheet to create a
    harmonized dataset. Once harmonization is finished, the package also has
    functions that will create descriptive statistics using 'RMarkdown'. Data
    Harmonization guidelines have been described by Fortier I, Raina P,
    Van den Heuvel ER, et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyw075>. Additional
    details of our R package have been described by Stephen JJ, Carolan P,
    Krefman AE, et al. (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.patter.2024.101003>.
